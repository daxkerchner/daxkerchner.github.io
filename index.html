              <p>I was a software engineer for several years each at Amazon (on Amazon Go, back when it was super secret) and  Google (yes, Google is as fun to work for as they say).
              </p>
              <p>Now I teach software engineering for Fullstack Academy (an online coding bootcamp), which is basically my dream job. I like coding, but I <em>love</em> coding with 30 people watching me.
              </p>
              <p>I specialize in technical interview prep, having given interviews to candidates at Google.  I have offered interview coaching freelance, but I am not currently taking clients, but instead just providing it to my students (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.fullstackacademy.com/">come join our program!</a>).  Reviews:</p>
              <ul><em><li>[Dax] will tailor the interview to your specific skill level. . . . Once the interview is done, he will provide you with a google doc scoring you in different categories from 1-4 based on how well you did (rubric he pulled straight from Google’s hiring process).  He also provides written feedback . . .
              </li>
              <li>Out of the few mock interviews I have done thus far, my practice with Dax felt the most helpful. He asked targeted questions and shared insights, and my time with him gave me some overall takeaways of things I should think about going into the interview. Dax also is very personable, and you can tell he genuinely has your best interest in mind.
              </li></em></ul>

                <p>I’ve written a few songs, and I play regularly at open mic nights.

                <p>I play in a fingerpicking style on guitar and often in a jazz style on piano.  I occasionally play accordion.

                <p>I don’t have any music on the internet yet, but you can watch these videos for a taste (or better yet, come to the open mic nights).
