          <p>I graduated from University of Florida in 2014 with a B.S. in math and computer science and a specialization in exploring the woods, and I am now living back in Gainesville, Florida.  My life peaked when I won a statewide 6th grade math competition in 5th grade, and now I <del>live under a bridge counting turtles</del> teach professional software engineering and love it.</p>
          <h2>What I do during work hours</h2>
          <p>I was a software engineer for several years each at Amazon (on Amazon Go, back when it was super secret) and  Google (yes, Google is as fun to work for as they say).
          </p>
          <p>Now I teach software engineering for Fullstack Academy (an online code bootcamp), which is basically my dream job. I like coding, but I <em>love</em> coding with 30 people watching me.
          </p>
          I specialize in technical interview prep, having given interviews to candidates at Google.  I have offered interview coaching freelance, but I am not currently taking clients, but instead just providing it to my students (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.fullstackacademy.com/">come join our program!</a>).

            <summary>Reviews:</summary>
            <ul><li>[Dax] will tailor the interview to your specific skill level. . . . Once the interview is done, he will provide you with a google doc scoring you in different categories from 1-4 based on how well you did (rubric he pulled straight from Google’s hiring process).  He also provides written feedback . . .
            </li>
            <li>Out of the few mock interviews I have done thus far, my practice with Dax felt the most helpful. He asked targeted questions and shared insights, and my time with him gave me some overall takeaways of things I should think about going into the interview. Dax also is very personable, and you can tell he genuinely has your best interest in mind.

              </li>
              <li>I’m in leadership in my church.  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/RanrTmCf6UE?feature=share&t=2567">Here’s a sermon I preached a few years ago</a> (it was only my third, go easy on me)

          <p><strong>I always like making new friends, so if you live in north/central Florida and want to join in any of those things—or introduce <em>me</em> to something new—hit me up!
          </strong></p>
          <p>Also, at the moment I’m <em>particularly</em> looking for fellow Christian musicians to get a <strong>hymn jam</strong> started.

          <h2>What I do in my sleep</h2>
          <p>I’m involved in chases more epic than the greatest action movies.  You should see how I jump through windows.  I rarely fly ‘cause I don’t need to
          </p>
          <h2>Like & subscribe</h2>
          <p>I don’t use social media. Instead, I keep in touch with friends through an email newsletter. Let me know if you’d like me to add you!
