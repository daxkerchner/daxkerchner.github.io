            <section>
              <p>I am a software engineer‚ÄîI worked for several years each at Amazon (on Amazon Go, back when it was super secret) and  Google (yes, Google is as fun to work for as they say).
              </p>
              <p>I currently teach software engineering for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fullstackacademy.com/programs/coding-bootcamp">Fullstack Academy</a> (an online coding bootcamp), which is basically my dream job. I like coding, but I <em>love</em> coding with 30 people watching me.
              </p>
              <p>I specialize in technical interview prep, having given interviews to candidates at Google. I have limited availability for interview coaching due to my teaching obligations, but if you're looking a premium, highly specialized arrangement, <a href="#contact">contact me</a>.  Reviews:</p>
              <ul><em><li>[Dax] will tailor the interview to your specific skill level. . . . Once the interview is done, he will provide you with a google doc scoring you in different categories from 1-4 based on how well you did (rubric he pulled straight from Google‚Äôs hiring process).  He also provides written feedback . . .
              </li>
              <li>Out of the few mock interviews I have done thus far, my practice with Dax felt the most helpful. He asked targeted questions and shared insights, and my time with him gave me some overall takeaways of things I should think about going into the interview. Dax also is very personable, and you can tell he genuinely has your best interest in mind.
              </li></em></ul>
